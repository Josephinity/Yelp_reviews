Tako found its new space on Hampden, then the original landlord's deal fell through. So Tako is in a new location, and landlord has an empty restaurant storefront. Serves him right! Back to Tako. The new space is much smaller than the old space. There is not bar. There are no beers on draft. Having a cold Kirin Ichiban draft at the old location was one of the true pleasures of eating at Tako.

The location is in the \"Shoppes of Bethesda\" the odd strip mall on Hampton with the liquor and UPS stores. In the evening, there is plenty of paid parking.  But you paid on Wisconsin as well.

        "1   Tako was our go-to sushi place when it was at its old Wisconsin Avenue location. We mourned its passing. Apparently by the way it was all for nought. The staff at the new location told me that Tako was kicked out by its former landlord who intended to sell the property. Tako found its new space on Hampden, then the original landlord's deal fell through. So Tako is in a new location, and landlord has an empty restaurant storefront. Serves him right! Back to Tako. The new space is much smaller than the old space. There is not bar. There are no beers on draft. Having a cold Kirin Ichiban draft at the old location was one of the true pleasures of eating at Tako. Sushi is still good and fresh. There is little innovation, but it's good. We didn't have grilled food this time, and having a grill is one of Tako's nice advantages over the typical sushi joint. Service was good. Our server was young, possibly high school or college, and sweet. Sushi orders come out pretty fast. Their miso soup is among the best I've ...   \n",

But the service can be so attentive it borders on intrusive. This is the rare Japanese restaurant that feels overstaffed.  Also, the fish is not being handled by someone who understands manners.   If you run out of something one night and are unable to include it in a dish that specifically lists it as an ingredient, you tell your servers to warn people BEFORE they order a dish. Otherwise, this is false advertisement.  On the rare occasion you run out of something in the middle of the night before you can tell the servers, you make sure to train them to be up front about it instead of simply replacing the missing ingredient with a more expensive substitute without apology or request for permission.    \n",

You will be disappointed. It's pricy and they don't handle being busy well, at all. My friend didn't get her sushi only her salad but didn't feel like asking or paying for it so we just asked for the check.   Won't be coming here for anything other than lunch ever again.    \n",
        "9   New location for Tako Grill!  The old location has been teetering on redevelopment for years.  Since Hinode closed, it's location seemed logical for Tako fans. After many delays, the new restaurant opened with some of the old hands, but many new ones, hopefully for the better. The location is in the \"Shoppes of Bethesda\" the odd strip mall on Hampton with the liquor and UPS stores. In the evening, there is plenty of paid parking.  But you paid on Wisconsin as well.  The new restaurant lacks a sign at the entrance door, so 1/2 the people went to exit door, including us!  There is an entry, with a hostess stand. Unlike the old place, there is no bar, in fact, all booze seems to come out of a back set up area.  Everything is clean and fresh with a nice sushi bar and lots of seating.  On a Sunday night, it was full of Japanese and Bethesda families of all ages. It doesn't seem like a hipster sushi bar with little decor or fancy dishes.   On to the sushi!  Top grade tuna, toro and yellowtail for sashimi - melt...   \n",

The food was delicious, without exception. There was a vegan and a vegetarian among us, and the waitress was very helpful in directing them to what turned out to be a fair number of choices. The rest of us mostly had a variety of sushi, which was fresh-tasting and very good. The prices are reasonable (not cheap), and the service was great. I'm sure we will be returning.    \n",

I used to regularly eat at another Bethesda Japanese restaurant that has recently changed ownership and gone seriously down hill, so Tako Grill is new for me. The owners are Japanese which is a huge plus; in addition to high quality fish for sushi and sashimi, they serve a very good variety of Japanese dishes beyond standard sushi restaurant fare. Service is friendly. Highly recommended.    \n",
